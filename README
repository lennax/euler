Using Scicoslab Toolbox:

	For running in source directory, launch scicoslab from the mavsim directory:
	1a. launch a terminal in mavsim root directory where this README is located.
		Then type scicoslab.

	If mavsim toolbox is installed in the 
	system path (i.e. /usr/lib/scicos../contrib)
	1b. launch scicoslab

	Opening the toolbox
	2. select menu toolboxes->mavsim-toolbox
	3. select menu Demos->"mavsim block demos"

Using Trim Application: 

	If the mavsim is installed.
	1a. launch the application: ./build/bin/mavsimTrim

	If you are building from source.
	1b. launch the application: mavsimTrim

Building from Source:

	Notes:
		
		The code only works for debian sid/squeeze and ubuntu maverick currently due to an
		issue with osgstateset with osg  version < 2.8.3

	Get the dependencies:

		For debian sid/squeeze and ubuntu maverick:
		sudo apt-get install cmake libqt4-dev simgear-dev liblapack-dev libboost-all-dev libopenscenegraph-dev gfortran
		
		If you need to build jsbsim from source (most likely since you need jsbsim-advtrim branch from mavsim)
		sudo apt-get install libtool automake

		Install scicoslab 4.4:
		Download from www.scicoslab.org 
		Or if you are using debian and you have hsl.dynalias.com on your package list: sudo apt-get install scicoslab-gtk	

	Build the code:
	
		./autobuild.sh

Packaging:

	CPack may by used for packaging.
	
	For example:
	cd build; cpack -g TGZ, will generate a tarball of the source.
	cd build; cpack -g DEB, will generate a debian package.
	cd build; cpack -g ZIP, will generate a zip of the source.
